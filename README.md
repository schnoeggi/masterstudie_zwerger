# Masters_Thesis Zwerger

This is the open source code for the Master Thesis of Carolin Zwerger, BSc.
To run the application you first need to configure a Firebase Project inside the `nuxt.config` file.
Due to size constraints the video files tha originally would be located at `static/video_src` are not available anymore. The links of the used TikTok videos are saved in the excel data "TikTokVideos_Tags_Links".

To run the project please make sure [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed and follow the Build Setup.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).
